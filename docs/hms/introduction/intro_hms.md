Welcome to the documentation for ProteinFeatures. This is the welcome page for documentation specific to people working within the Silver Lab at HMS.

If you are not at HMS or in the Silver Lab, feel free to still read through this part of the documentation. There's nothing private here, it just may not be as appliciable to you.

The following sections assume that you have access to the O2 cluster and the `/n/groups/drad/` directory.

Thanks for taking a look! Please feel free to contact me directly at julianstanleya [at] gmail [dot] com if you have any questions.
