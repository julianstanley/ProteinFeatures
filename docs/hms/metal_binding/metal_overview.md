title: Metal Binding Overview
---

Metal binding comes in two parts: `findsitemetal` output and `uniprotmetal` output.

`findsitemetal` documentation can be found in the `findsitemetal` folder in this repo, which includes notes from RLC and the official findsite manual.

A script to convert LOMETS init.dat output files to findsite template input lists can be found in `/n/groups/drad/julian/findsite`.

Scripts to extract metal files from UniProt can be found in `/n/groups/drad/julian/uniprotmetal`.
