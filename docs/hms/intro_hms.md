Welcome to the documentation for ProteinFeatures. This is the welcome page for documentation specific to people working within the Silver Lab at HMS.

This assumes that you have access to the O2 cluster and the `/n/groups/drad/` directory.

Thanks for taking a look! Please feel free to contact me directly at julianstanleya [at] gmail [dot] com if you have any questions.
