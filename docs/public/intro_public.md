Thanks for visiting, I hope this documentation can be helpful to you.

Right now, these are still very much a work in progress.

If you are a researcher in the Silver Lab at Harvard Medical School, click the "Docs (HMS)" link in the navbar. That will take you to instructions that are specific to people working with access to the Silver lab's folders on the O2 server. Right now (April 2020) I'm focusing on completing those.

If you are coming from outside of HMS, hang tight! I'm still working on more general instructions. Or, please don't hesitate to create a GitHub issue or email me (see the 'help' tab).
