title: Welcome to the Docs!

Thanks for visiting, I hope this documentation can be helpful to you.

Right now, I am still frantically writing these docs. 

If you are a researcher in the Silver Lab at Harvard Medical School, click the "Docs (HMS)" link in the navbar. That will take you to instructions that are specific to people working with access to the Silver lab's folders on the O2 server.

If you are coming from outside of HMS, hang tight! I'm still working on more general instructions. But, for more info, please feel free to email me at julian_stanley [at] hms [dot] harvard [dot] edu.
